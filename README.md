# The Burn Book: Members Only
This Project is an app built using Ruby on Rails, to implement the creation of The Burn Book, a Members Only Web app where you can post "burns" or mean posts about other people. However, you can only see who has created the "burn" post when you are signed up and signed in, otherwise, too bad! You won't know who!

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project
This Project is an app built using Ruby on Rails, to implement the creation of The Burn Book, a Members Only Web app where you can post "burns" or mean posts about other people and only see who has posted what when you're signed up/in. It was also a way to get a lot of healthy experience with using Devise in the process.
This project demonstrates a User Role system giving the web application and native application feel all within the browser. We used Rails generators to help scaffold views. The app features the CRUD principle where we create, read, update and destroy "Burns" (posts). We used the Devise gem which makes creating an entire user role and authentication system a lot easier.
